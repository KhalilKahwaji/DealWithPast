  - `Gamification/PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step implementation checklist for Weeks 3-5

### Started
- **Phase 1: Mission Discovery Foundation** (Weeks 3-5)

  - üöß WordPress plugin setup (in progress)
  - üöß Missions custom post type (pending)
  - üöß Database schema implementation (pending)

### Decisions Made
- ‚úÖ **WordPress Developer Confirmed:** Ziad (15-20 hrs/week)
- ‚úÖ **Cultural Advisor Confirmed:** Ziad (Lebanese, project lead - eliminates HIGH risk)
- ‚úÖ **Artist:** Confirmed and working on Phase 1 assets
- ‚úÖ **Development Approach:** Direct to dwp.world (no staging site)
- ‚úÖ **Flutter Communication:** Ziad will brief Flutter team with branch updates

### Risks Resolved
- ~~‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: WordPress developer availability~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ RESOLVED (Ziad confirmed)
- ~~‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: Cultural design rejection risk~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ RESOLVED (Ziad is Lebanese cultural lead)

### Phase 1 Goals (Weeks 3-5)
**WordPress Backend:**
- [ ] Create `dwp-gamification` plugin
- [ ] Register `mission` custom post type with 9 ACF fields
- [ ] Create 3 database tables (user_missions, user_achievements, notifications)
- [ ] Implement 6 REST API endpoints (nearby, details, start, complete, my-missions, achievements)
- [ ] Build achievement system (7 achievements with auto-unlock)
- [ ] Populate 10 test missions in Beirut area

**Timeline:** 36 hours over 3 weeks (12 hrs/week)

### Next Actions (Week 3)
- [ ] **Day 1-2:** Create WordPress plugin structure (10 hours)
- [ ] **Day 3:** Create database schema (4 hours)
- [ ] **Day 4-5:** Populate test missions (4 hours)
- [ ] **Week 4:** Implement Mission API endpoints (12 hours)
- [ ] **Week 5:** Build achievement system (10 hours)

### Metrics
- Documentation Created: 4 additional planning documents (4,000+ lines total across all Phase 0 docs)
- Git Branch: `feature/gamification` created and tracked
- WordPress Plugin: 0% (starting now)
- API Endpoints: 0/6 implemented
- Test Missions: 0/10 created

## [2025-10-10] - Gamification System Planning & Technical Analysis

### Added
- **Gamification Planning Documentation** (Phase 0 - Week 1)
  - `Gamification/concept.md` - 2-Pillar gamification system design
  - `Gamification/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep dive into existing architecture and integration points
  - `Gamification/WORDPRESS_BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Complete WordPress API specification (23 endpoints, 3 DB tables)
  - `Gamification/PHASED_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md` - 8-10 week phased implementation plan

### Analysis Completed
- ‚úÖ **Current Tech Stack Analyzed:**
  - Flutter 3.10.6 (Dart 3.0.6) with native Google Maps (not plugin!)
  - WordPress REST API at dwp.world with ACF custom fields
  - JWT authentication already in place
  - SQLite local caching implemented
  - Firebase Auth already integrated

- ‚úÖ **Integration Points Identified:**
  - Map enhancement for mission discovery (easy - clustering already works)
  - Quest banner widget (medium - needs priority algorithm)
  - Achievement system (medium - needs server-side logic)
  - Memorial plaque generator (high complexity - Lebanese cultural design required)
  - Push notifications (medium - FCM integration needed)

### Strategic Decisions
- **Timeline Revised:** Original 3-week sprint ‚Üí 8-10 week phased rollout
  - **Rationale:** Team project + WordPress backend unknown + cultural sensitivity review required

- **Phased Approach:**
  - Phase 0 (Weeks 1-2): Planning & preparation ‚Üê **CURRENT**
  - Phase 1 (Weeks 3-5): Mission discovery foundation
  - Phase 2 (Weeks 6-7): Community building & achievements
  - Phase 3 (Weeks 8-9): Legacy system & memorial plaque
  - Phase 4 (Week 10): Polish & launch

### Technical Requirements Documented

**WordPress Backend Needs:**
- NEW Custom Post Type: `missions` with ACF fields
- NEW Database Tables: `wp_user_missions`, `wp_user_achievements`, `wp_notifications`
- NEW API Endpoints: 23 endpoints across 5 categories
- NEW Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- Estimated: 120-160 hours WordPress development

**Flutter Mobile App Needs:**
- NEW Models: Mission, Achievement, FollowRelationship, GeoLocation
- NEW Repos: MissionRepo, AchievementRepo
- NEW Screens: MissionDiscoveryMap, MissionCreationWizard, AchievementPage
- NEW Widgets: QuestBanner, MissionMarker, MemorialPlaque
- NEW Packages: firebase_messaging, qr_flutter (test Flutter 3.10.6 compatibility!)
- Estimated: 240-320 hours Flutter development

**Design Needs:**
- 14 achievement badge icons
- Lebanese cultural memorial plaque design
- Mission marker icons
- Quest banner variants (3 layouts)
- Cultural advisor approval required

### Critical Risks Identified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH:** WordPress developer availability unknown (blocks entire project)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH:** Cultural design rejection risk (requires Lebanese advisor approval)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** Flutter 3.10.6 package compatibility (2 years old)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** Push notification setup complexity (FCM on WordPress)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** Map performance with 100+ missions (need optimization strategy)

### Next Actions (Week 1)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Schedule team meeting to review planning documents
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Identify and confirm WordPress developer (15-20 hrs/week commitment)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Identify and onboard Lebanese cultural advisor
- [ ] Set up `feature/gamification` git branch
- [ ] Test required Flutter packages with Flutter 3.10.6
- [ ] Create wireframes for all new screens
- [ ] Set up mock API server for parallel Flutter development

### Metrics
- Documentation Created: 4 comprehensive planning documents (2,000+ lines total)
- Tasks Analyzed: Architecture deep dive completed (Map, Story, User models reviewed)
- APIs Specified: 23 REST endpoints fully documented
- Database Tables: 3 new tables specified with schema
- Risks Identified: 7 major risks with mitigation strategies
- Timeline Estimated: 8-10 weeks phased rollout

### Important Notes
üìö **READ FIRST:** All team members should review these documents before implementation:
  1. Start with `PHASED_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md` for overview
  2. WordPress devs: Read `WORDPRESS_BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  3. Flutter devs: Read `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
  4. Designers: Review `concept.md` section on cultural design

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Do NOT start implementation until:
  - WordPress developer confirmed and onboarded
  - Cultural advisor identified and approved design direction
  - Team meeting held and plan approved
  - Mock API server set up for parallel development
