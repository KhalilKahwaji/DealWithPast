## Issues Encountered ⚠️

### Flutter Tool Initialization
- **Problem**: Flutter command stuck in infinite retry loop trying to upgrade pub packages
- **Error**: "The system cannot find the path specified" during tool building
- **Root Cause**: PATH environment variables not properly loaded + missing Flutter tool dependencies
- **Solution**: System restart required to refresh environment

### Missing Components
- **Missing**: Main Flutter packages directory structure
- **Impact**: Prevents flutter tool from initializing properly
- **Status**: Should resolve after restart and proper PATH recognition

## Session: October 12, 2025 - Mission System Implementation

### 🎯 Achievement: Complete Mission Creation & Discovery System

**Context**: Users needed the ability to create location-based missions through the mobile app, similar to how stories work. Previous system only allowed admin creation via WordPress backend.

### ✅ Backend Implementation (WordPress Plugin)
**File**: `wordpress-plugin/dwp-gamification/includes/class-api-endpoints.php`
- Added `POST /wp-json/dwp/v1/missions/create` endpoint
- Requires user authentication (JWT token)
- Accepts parameters:
  - `title` (required) - Mission title
  - `description` (required) - Mission description
  - `latitude` (required) - GPS coordinate
  - `longitude` (required) - GPS coordinate
  - `address` (optional) - Human-readable location
  - `difficulty` (optional) - easy/medium/hard (default: easy)
  - `mission_type` (optional) - visit/interview/photograph/research/memorial
  - `reward_points` (optional) - Points awarded (default: 10)
- Creates mission as published post with all ACF fields
- Returns formatted mission data with success message

**Plugin Package**: `wordpress-plugin/dwp-gamification.zip` (ready for deployment)

### ✅ Flutter App Implementation

**New Files Created**:
1. **`lib/Repos/MissionRepo.dart`** - Mission service layer
   - `getNearbyMissions()` - Fetch missions within radius using Haversine formula
   - `createMission()` - Create new user-generated mission
   - `getMissionDetails()` - Get single mission info
   - `startMission()` - Mark mission as active
   - `completeMission()` - Submit mission completion with proof
   - `getMyMissions()` - Get user's mission history

2. **`lib/Missions/createMission.dart`** - Mission creation screen
   - Full-page Arabic RTL interface
   - Google Places picker integration for location selection
   - Difficulty dropdown: سهل (Easy) / متوسط (Medium) / صعب (Hard)
   - Mission type dropdown: زيارة موقع / مقابلة شخص / تصوير موقع / بحث في أرشيف / إنشاء نصب تذكاري
   - Reward points input field (default: 10)
   - Form validation
   - Success/error dialogs with navigation

**Modified Files**:
3. **`lib/Map/map.dart`** - Enhanced map with mission support
   - Added mission state management (missions list, viewMode, mainMission)
   - `retrieveMissions()` - Loads nearby missions (50km radius)
   - `switchViewMode()` - Toggle between stories/missions view
   - `updateMapMarkers()` - Clear and reload appropriate markers
   - `loadMissionMarkers()` - Display missions as green map pins
   - **Toggle UI**: Two-button filter at top of map
     - "الروايات" (Stories) - Yellow highlight when active
     - "المهمات" (Missions) - Green highlight when active
     - Exclusive view mode (prevents map clutter)
   - **FloatingActionButton**: Green button with flag icon to create missions

### 🎨 UX Design Decisions
- **Color Coding**: Stories = Yellow, Missions = Green (consistent throughout UI)
- **Exclusive Views**: Toggle prevents both stories and missions showing simultaneously
- **Location Integration**: Reuses existing Google Places API for consistency
- **Arabic Labels**: Full RTL support with proper Arabic terminology

### 📋 Technical Architecture
- **Location Search**: Haversine formula calculates distance between user and missions
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth → WordPress JWT token flow
- **Data Format**: JSON with proper sanitization and validation
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following existing patterns

### 🧪 Status
- ✅ All code complete and integrated
- ✅ WordPress plugin packaged and uploaded to dwp.world
- ✅ Plugin tested and working
- ✅ End-to-end testing complete (mission creation and display verified)

### 📦 Deliverables
- WordPress plugin ZIP ready for deployment
- Flutter app with complete mission creation and discovery system
- Toggle UI for switching between stories and missions
- Location-based mission loading with 50km radius
