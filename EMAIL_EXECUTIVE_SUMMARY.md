**Subject:** Action Required: DealWithPast App Production Launch - Accounts & Team Involvement Needed

---

Dear UNDP Team,

As we approach the production launch of the **DealWithPast (خارطة وذاكرة)** mobile app, I need your help with critical accounts and clarification on ongoing team involvement.

---

## **TL;DR - What I Need From You:**

### **1. Accounts to Create (This Week)**
- **Apple Developer Account** - $99/year - for iOS App Store
- **Google Play Account** - $25 one-time - for Android
- **Google Cloud Account** - $0-20/month initially - for Firebase & Maps
  - *Currently using my personal account - must transfer to UNDP ownership*

### **2. Team Members Needed**
- **Content Moderators** (2-3 people) - Review stories/missions daily
  - Time commitment: 30-60 min/day
- **Primary Contact** - For urgent decisions/approvals
- **Legal Review** - Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

### **3. Decisions Needed**
- Content moderation policy - What's acceptable/prohibited?
- User approval workflow - Auto-publish or manual review?
- Target launch date - When do you want to go live?

---

## **Why This Matters**

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- Can't launch on app stores without Apple/Google accounts
- Can't use my personal accounts for production (data ownership, liability)
- Need billing set up for Google services (even free tier requires credit card)

**Content Management:**
- User-generated content needs oversight (inappropriate content, misinformation)
- Legal requirement: Content moderation for public apps
- Brand protection: UNDP name/reputation at stake

**Long-term Success:**
- App needs ongoing maintenance (not one-time launch)
- Team needs to own/control infrastructure
- Support & moderation = sustainable community

---

## **Quick Budget Overview**

**Setup Costs (One-time):**
- Apple + Google accounts: **$124 USD**

**Monthly Costs (Ongoing):**
- Google Cloud (current usage): **$0-20 USD/month**
- Scales to $50-100/month with 2,000+ active users
- Apple renewal: $99/year

**All very affordable for an organizational app.**

---

## **Next Steps**

**I've prepared a detailed document** (attached) covering:
- Complete account setup instructions
- Content moderation workflows
- Legal requirements (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
- Long-term maintenance expectations
- 8-week launch timeline
- Budget breakdown

**Can we schedule a 1-hour call this week to discuss?**

**Proposed agenda:**
1. Review account requirements (15 min)
2. Discuss content moderation strategy (20 min)
3. Assign team responsibilities (10 min)
4. Set timeline & next steps (15 min)
