# Phased Rollout Plan - DealWithPast Gamification
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Project Manager:** Z
**Approach:** Incremental delivery with user testing and validation
**Total Timeline:** 8-10 weeks (revised from original 3 weeks)

---

## Executive Summary

The original 3-week sprint timeline is **too aggressive** for a team project with complex WordPress integration, cultural sensitivity requirements, and mobile development. This phased rollout plan extends the timeline to 8-10 weeks with incremental delivery, reducing risk and allowing for proper testing and cultural validation.

### Why Phased Rollout?

1. **WordPress Backend Unknown:** Backend developer capacity/timeline not confirmed
2. **Team Coordination:** Multiple developers require careful coordination
3. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Lebanese cultural advisor review is critical
4. **Testing Required:** Each phase needs user validation before proceeding
5. **Risk Mitigation:** Can pivot or stop if issues discovered early

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**1. WordPress Developer Unavailable**
- **Probability:** HIGH
- **Impact:** CRITICAL (blocks entire project)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Identify WordPress developer in Phase 0 (Week 1)
  - If unavailable, hire external contractor immediately
  - Use mock API server for Flutter dev (already planned)
  - Backend can lag Flutter by 1 week if needed

**2. Cultural Design Rejected**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** HIGH (requires redesign, adds 1-2 weeks)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Early advisor involvement (Phase 0)
  - Multiple design options prepared
  - Iterative feedback (don't wait until final)
  - Backup simple design (text-only plaque if needed)

**3. Flutter Package Incompatibility (Flutter 3.10.6)**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (feature cut or workaround needed)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test packages in Phase 0, Week 2
  - Have backup plan for each package:
    - `firebase_messaging` → Manual polling fallback
    - `qr_flutter` → Use web API to generate QR
  - Coordinate Flutter upgrade with team if critical

**4. Push Notification Setup Complexity**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (delays Phase 2)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Allocate full week for FCM setup
  - Use Firebase documentation carefully
  - Test on real devices early (not emulators)
  - Fallback: In-app notifications only (no push)

### Medium-Risk Items

**5. Team Merge Conflicts**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (slows development)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use feature branch strategy
  - Daily standups for coordination
  - Code reviews before merge
  - Small, frequent commits

**6. Map Performance Degradation**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** LOW (UX suffers but not broken)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simple pin icons (not custom bitmaps)
  - Implement lazy loading early
  - Test with 100+ missions in Phase 1
  - Optimize based on profiling

**7. User Adoption Low**
- **Probability:** LOW
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (effort wasted if unused)
- **Mitigation:**
  - User testing at each phase
  - Iterate based on feedback
  - Make gamification optional/non-intrusive
  - Monitor analytics post-launch

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### After Phase 0 (Week 2)
**Go if:**
- WordPress developer confirmed and onboarded
- Team approved phased plan
- Cultural advisor approved design direction
- Mock API server working

**No-Go if:**
- No WordPress developer available → Pause, find contractor
- Cultural advisor unavailable → Find alternative advisor
- Team doesn't approve plan → Revise plan based on feedback

### After Phase 1 (Week 5)
**Go if:**
- Mission CRUD working end-to-end
- Map performance acceptable
- Quest banner functional
- Zero P0 bugs

**No-Go if:**
- WordPress API not ready → Extend Phase 1 by 1 week
- Map performance unacceptable → Simplify mission markers
- Critical bugs → Fix before proceeding

### After Phase 2 (Week 7)
**Go if:**
- Achievements unlocking correctly
- Push notifications working
- Cultural advisor approved designs
- Small test group positive feedback (4+ stars)

**No-Go if:**
- Cultural design rejected → Redesign (add 1 week)
- Push notifications broken → Fix or use fallback
- Test group negative feedback → Pivot or cancel

### After Phase 3 (Week 9)
**Go if:**
- Memorial plaque approved by cultural advisor
- Family sharing working
- All 14 achievements functional
- Expanded test group positive feedback

**No-Go if:**
- Cultural advisor rejects plaque → Redesign
- Critical bugs → Fix before launch
- Performance unacceptable → Optimize

---

## Rollback & Contingency Plans

### If Project Cancelled Mid-Way

**After Phase 1:**
- Keep mission discovery as standalone feature
- No dependencies on later phases
- Remove quest banner if unwanted

**After Phase 2:**
- Keep achievements as motivational feature
- Remove memorial plaque references
- Notifications can be generic (not just gamification)

### If Timeline Slips

**Add 1 Week to Phase 1:**
- Common if WordPress dev slower than expected
- Push entire timeline back 1 week
- Re-evaluate resources

**Add 1 Week to Phase 3:**
- Common if cultural review requires iteration
- Not critical - can extend before launch
- Quality more important than timeline

### If Resources Lost

**WordPress Developer Leaves:**
- Pause project immediately
- Hire contractor (budget $10-15k for remaining work)
- Resume with new developer onboarded

**Flutter Developer Leaves:**
- Reduce scope (cut Phase 3 if needed)
- Extend timeline to allow slower pace
- Redistribute tasks to remaining devs
