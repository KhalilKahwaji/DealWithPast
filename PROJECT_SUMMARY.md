Complete mission gamification system for Deal With Past (Lebanese Civil War memory preservation app) with Flutter mobile app and WordPress backend.

---

## What Was Built

### ✅ 1. Mission Discovery System (Flutter)
- **Mission markers** on Google Maps with green pins
- **Toggle view** between Stories and Missions
- **Mission discovery card** with smooth slide-up animation
- **Clean UI** with proper spacing (25px), readable fonts (17-20px)
- **HTML stripping** from WordPress content (removes `wp:paragraph`, tags)
- **Null-safety** to prevent crashes
- **Category display** with difficulty badges (easy/medium/hard)
- **Location and points** display

### ✅ 2. Mission REST API (WordPress)
- **GET `/dwp/v1/missions/nearby`** - Find missions by location (Haversine formula, 100km radius)
- **GET `/dwp/v1/missions/{id}`** - Get mission details with user status
- **POST `/dwp/v1/missions/create`** - Create new missions (pending approval)
- **POST `/dwp/v1/missions/start`** - Start a mission
- **POST `/dwp/v1/missions/complete`** - Complete with proof media
- **GET `/dwp/v1/missions/my-missions`** - User's mission history
- **Auto-calculated rules** - Goals, points, duration based on difficulty
- **Safety first** - ALL missions pending approval (no auto-publish)

### ✅ 3. Mission Categories & Rules
**Social Missions** (Community Quests):
- Easy: 5 goals, 3 followers, 30 days, 50 points
- Medium: 15 goals, 10 followers, 60 days, 150 points
- Hard: 30 goals, 25 followers, 90 days, 300 points

**Personal Missions** (Tributes):
- Easy: 1 goal, 0 followers, no expiry, 25 points
- Medium: 1 goal, 0 followers, no expiry, 50 points
- Hard: 1 goal, 0 followers, no expiry, 100 points

### ✅ 4. Emoji Reactions System
- **🙏❤️😊😢** Four emojis for personal mission tributes
- **One reaction per user** (can change, removes previous)
- **POST `/dwp/v1/missions/react`** - Add reaction
- **GET `/dwp/v1/missions/{id}/reactions`** - Get all reactions
- **POST `/dwp/v1/missions/unreact`** - Remove reaction
- **Auto-included** in mission data for personal category
- **Stored in ACF** `reactions` field as user ID arrays

### ✅ 5. Social Sharing
- **GET `/dwp/v1/missions/{id}/share?platform={platform}`**
- **WhatsApp** - Direct `wa.me` link with formatted message
- **Facebook** - Share dialog with OG meta tags
- **Twitter** - Tweet intent with hashtags, 280-char limit
- **Generic** - Formatted text for any platform
- **Arabic support** - 🇱🇧 جزء من قصص الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية
- **Different emojis** - 🎯 social, 🙏 personal
- **Open Graph & Twitter Card** meta tags for rich previews

### ✅ 6. Admin Moderation UI
- **Pending Missions page** with count badge
- **Quick approve/reject** with AJAX (no page refresh)
- **Custom list columns**: Category icons, difficulty colors, reactions
- **Advanced filtering**: By category (social/personal) and difficulty
- **Metadata tracking**: `_approved_by`, `_rejected_by`, `_rejection_reason`
- **Rejection reasons** with optional note
- **Dashicons** and color coding (green/orange/red)
- **Human-readable time** ("2 hours ago")

### ✅ 7. Database Schema
- **`wp_user_missions`** - User mission progress tracking
- **`wp_achievements`** - Badge definitions
- **`wp_user_achievements`** - User badge collection
- **ACF fields** - Missions metadata (lat/lng, difficulty, category, etc.)

### ✅ 8. Safety & Security
- **All missions pending** approval before publish
- **Nonce verification** for all AJAX actions
- **Capability checks** (`edit_posts` permission)
- **Input sanitization** on all endpoints
- **WordPress REST auth** for protected endpoints
